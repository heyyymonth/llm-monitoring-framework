Comprehensive Quality Monitoring Tests

This module provides extensive testing for LLM quality assessment capabilities,
focusing on the four core quality dimensions:
- Semantic Similarity: Prompt-response alignment scoring
- Factual Accuracy: Content verification and consistency  
- Response Relevance: Topic and context relevance assessment
- Coherence Score: Language quality and structure analysis
