Factual Accuracy Monitoring Demonstration

This script demonstrates the new comprehensive factual accuracy monitoring feature
that evaluates content verification and consistency in LLM responses.

Features demonstrated:
- Internal consistency and contradiction detection
- Citation and reference verification
- Quantitative data accuracy (numbers, dates, statistics)
- Knowledge consistency assessment
- Temporal accuracy evaluation
